The goal of rtorch-minimal-book is to ...

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{css echo=FALSE}
.bad-code { background-color: red; }
```

```{r df-drop-2, class.source="bad-code"}
mtcars[, "mpg"] 
```


<style>
div.blue pre { background-color:lightblue; }
div.blue pre.r { background-color:blue; }
</style>


<div class = "blue">
```{r bluecars}
summary(cars)
```
</div>

```{r normal}
summary(cars)
```

```{r class="watch-out"}
mtcars[1:5, "mpg"]
```


```{r class.source="watch-out", class.source="watch-out"}
library(rTorch)
```

```{css}
.badCode {
background-color: red;
}
```

```{r torch-config, class.source="badCode"}
library(rTorch)
rTorch::torch_config()
```



```{r cars, class.source="bg-danger", class.output="bg-warning"}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!

This is a minimal tutorial of rTorch, a package based on PyTorch. This book has been written in R Markdown using **bookdown** (<https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown>).


```{r class.source="bg-danger", class.output="bg-warning"}
mtcars[1:5, "mpg"]
```
